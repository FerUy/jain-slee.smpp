					The SmppTransaction represents the message
					submitted/received and corresponding message
					response received/submitted. The Activity begins
					when ResourceAdaptor receives a SMS Request and
					fires the corresponding event to SBB and ends as
					soon as listening SBB sends back Response.If there
					is no SBB listening for this event, the timeout
					occurs and Activity is killed. Other way is Activity
					is started as soon as SBB sends SMS message and ends
					once RA receives the message response or timeout
					occurs, which ever is first. Class name is
